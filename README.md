# CrackSeU
This repository is the official implementation of the **Crack** **Se**gmentation **U**-shape (**CrackSeU**) Network.

### ðŸ”¥ Break News:  
Our paper is finally accepted by Automation in Construction after a year of review. I have to say it has been a long and tough journey. ðŸ˜­.

The paper is available:  
[Online monitoring of crack dynamic development using attention-based deep networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580523002820), Automation in Construction, 154 (2023) 105022, by Wang chen*, [Zhili He](http://zl-he.com/)*, and Jian Zhang#. ( *: Co-first authors, #: Corresponding Author )

# Getting Started
### 1. Requirement
~~~
Recommended versions are
    * python = 3.5
    * pytorch = 1.12.1
    * CUDA 11.6.2 and CUDNN 8.6.0  
Other requirements can be found in the Requirements.txt.
~~~

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hzlbbfrog/CrackSeU
cd CrackSeU
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```
Or, you can directly "Download ZIP".

### 3. Build your own dataset
You can refer to the following file tree to organize your own data.
```
Your project
â”‚   README.md
â”‚   ...
â”‚   CrackSeU_main.py
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€Dataset
    |
    â””â”€â”€â”€Your dataset name
        |
        â””â”€â”€â”€Train
            â””â”€â”€â”€images
            â””â”€â”€â”€masks
        â””â”€â”€â”€Test
            â””â”€â”€â”€images
            â””â”€â”€â”€masks
â”‚  
â””â”€â”€â”€...Other directories   
```

### 4. Training
To train the CrackSeU with LN_VT, simply run:
```shell
python CrackSeU_main.py --action=train --arch=CrackSeU_S_LN_VT --epoch=50 --batch_size=2 --lr=1e-4
```

### 5. Test
To test the CrackSeU with LN_VT, simply run:
```shell
python CrackSeU_main.py --action=test --arch=CrackSeU_S_LN_VT --test_epoch=50
```
